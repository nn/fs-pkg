We handle Xar Table Of Contents in a particularly ugly way right now...
	pkg.c:pkg_import(): Calls pkg_toc_extract
		pkg_toc.c:pkg_toc_extract(): Extracts TOC to /pkg/$pkg.toc
		pkg_toc.c:pkg_toc_load(): Parses the XML Table of Contents into db
	pkg.c:pkg_import(): unlink(/pkg/$pkg.XXXXXX) where XXXXXX is random

We need to look at extracting each TOC into a buffer then processing it.
	This shouldn't be too hard since we know the uncompressed TOC size.

We need to use errno more and add more error checking.


Probably should try to modify dictionary to be type-generic
	* If we do this, why not use it for package cache?
		- This should reduce some of the mess which
		  overhead of the cache versus using dlists. -bk
		  - I still think the cache will be a win either way -jld
